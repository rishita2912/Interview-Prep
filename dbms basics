3.ACID is an acronym that stands for Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, and Durability. These four 
properties are principles that ensure reliability and consistency in database transactions. 

Atomicity: If any part of the transaction fails, the entire transaction is rolled back to its original state,
and the database is left unchanged.

Consistency: Consistency ensures that the database remains in a consistent state before and after the execution of transactions.

Isolation: Isolation ensures that the concurrent execution of multiple transactions does not interfere with each other.

Durability: Durability guarantees that the changes made by a committed transaction are permanently saved.
